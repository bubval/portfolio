                <p>
                    My name is Lyubomir Valkov and I am 23 years old. I was born and raised in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria. In May 2020, I graduated the American University in Bulgaria 
                    with disciplinary honors in my Computer Science and Information Systems double major.
                    <br><br>
                    My education was focused on learning industry best practices, fundamental knowledge, clean code, and communication. We have explored both practical and 
                    theoretical aspects. I've taken part in several extracurricular projects and hackathons which can be found in the "Portfolio" section.
                    <br><br>
                    I have experience in iOS and web development. However, I am also interested in learning more about game development, neuro-evolution algorithms, DevOps, and Agile 
                    / project management.

                        I've gained experience in iOS development through my summer internship at Tumba Solutions and the completion several personal projects. When developing, I always strive for my code to be 
                        so clean that it can be read and understood as easily as English - Swift allows this to be a realistic goal. I find the language to be extremely well engineered and 
                        I find iOS development to be very fulfilling and rewarding.

                        My web development journey began in university. Although having learned markup, styling and javascript with some jQuery and AJAX, I did not see myself 
                        being a web developer until I tried .NET Core. I instantly took a liking to it and the whole Microsoft web stack. Since then, I've completed my CS senior project 
                        and several freelance websites using .NET Core. I'm also very interested in learning the MEVN stack.

                        development with the Unity Engine. Whenever I can, I try to develop Python scripts to automate and streamline repetitive actions. I tinker and experiment as often 
                        as I can. I enjoy learning new frameworks, languages and concepts.

                        This is my computer science senior project. I've developed a website which can, given enough data, use simple multiplicative decomposition algorithm to 
                        predict spikes and drops in prices of flagship mobile phones. Additionally, the website allows the user to input desired hardware specifications which the 
                        website takes into account, finds all suitable phones, forecasts their price and displays to the user when that phone would be cheapest to buy.

                        Features include playing songs via YouTube links, playing songs via Spotify links, playing songs via just writing the name of the song, adding songs in a 
                        queue to play one after another, skipping songs from the queue, stopping the current song and wiping the queue of following songs.

                    <p>
                        Flappy Bird is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game was developed by dotGears 
                        and released in May 2013. This project successfully implements an AI that teaches itself how to play the game to the point of being perfect. Essentially, after a 
                        couple of generations the AI becomes exponentially better until it eventually reaches a point where it cannot lose. The project uses a generic algorithm, 
                        specifically NEAT – Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies.
